## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
[- youtube.com
- stackoverflow
- Javascript&jquery by Jon Duckett
- HTML&CSS design and build websites by Jon Duckett]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[When I realized that we had to use css, html, and javascript to complete the pre-work project I got very nervous as I have never used these languages before. I also had no idea how exactly they interact with each other. I always wanted to know how to make websites. I was afraid to fail but I figured that even in my failure I will gain a lot of skills that will be of great use in the future. So, on I went to one of my professors to ask for some books on css, html, and javascript. I also went online to familiarize myself with these languages and their interactions. Then I tried to do the html part of the project from scratch without any template code. After a few hours of struggling, I decided to go onto glitch and try the actual project. I realized that the instructions were very easy to follow. I do not know if that was because I had tried to do it by myself before. 
Moreover, while implementing the additional features of the game, my program was glitching with errors that I could not really understand. I was at the verge of undoing all the additional features I had implemented to the point. Then I looked the errors on the console log of my developer tools. I went to stack-overflow to see what causes these errors. This helped me to understand and fix my errors and got my game back to working perfectly.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[I have had a bit of experience creating websites using drag and drop tools like Elementor and WordPress but never made any from scratch. What advantages does it have to develop your website from scratch instead of using drag and drop tools like Elementor? It seems like using such tools saves a lot of time and effort for the web developer. 
Another question I have is how much experience does it take one to make clean and professional websites like that of Apple? Lastly, a less technical question would be how hard is it for independent web developers to find job opportunities? With the rise of easier ways to make websites, wonâ€™t the demand for web developers decrease in the future?

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[With more time to work on this project, I would have the user see the number of tries they have left as this is often very helpful for the user. When playing other games, it is often very helpful to see the number of lives that one has left. I would also add a more attractive background like a video instead of the picture I used. I would also have a more attractive and dramatic intro video that introduces the game before the player can start. The win and lose would also have dramatic animations. These are things that seem small but they make the game more interactive and interesting. ]
